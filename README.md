## Abstract

Our topic involves the impact of architecture on collective behavior. By integrating different approaches (e.g., social force model, OCEAN/Big Five personality model), we seek to model not just crowd behavior, but behavior of different individuals within crowds, and how individual differences affect the degree to which environment influences behavior. Additionally, we seek to model how manipulating the environment (e.g., by designing buildings in a certain way) can lead to varying changes in collective behavior as a function of individual differences and social interactions. This topic is important because by exploring how physical spaces alter human behavior at the individual and crowd level, this work can inform the design of spaces as a means of motivating desired behaviors. Potential applications include:
* Safe evacuation/stampede prevention
* Sustainable behavior (e.g., recycling)
* Healthy behavior (e.g., being more physically active, preventing spread of disease)

## General Introduction

It is understood that humans' feelings are affected by their environment, both the built environment and the people they interact with. It is also understood that humans perfrom tasks differently based on their personality type. The OCEAN model provides a layout for a particular personality types given five degrees of freedom. We aim to show the propogation of a feeling throughout a crowd. With a better understanding how individuals react to their evironment, we can build and environment that best encourages a group of people the way we want to. People with personalities that better react to the built environment will begin to influence those who are more affected by human to human interactions and so on. Here we apply self organization theories to understand the best method to promote a "good" feeling within a space.

This type of propogation of feelings can also be applied to a space where safety is concerned. If we implement an initial condition of a dangerous event that sparks panic, such as a fire, bomb, or active shooter, we can understand how to build an environment to encourage the least amount of panic. This can help usher the most amount of people to safety as possible. Reactions to extreme events will rely heavily on the personalities of the individuals involved, and we seek to understand the best scenerio for all envolved.

We will begin by approaching the problem from a few different angles:

This project makes the following contributions:
•	(Contribution 1)
•	(Contribution 2)


## The Model

(Provide structural and behavior diagrams of the system you wish to study.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?) (Use the model to tell us what is going on.)

(explicitly list your requirements of what the model will have and simulate for the proposal)

## Fundamental Questions
(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions) (Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )

## Expected Results
(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?) (This changes from Expected (Proposal) to just Results (final report)) (you should verbally define them) (sketch a few graphs of what you are roughly going for - not the data but histogram of this, line graph of that, screenshot of an agent - use paper and pencil sketches)

## Research Methods
(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Discrete Event Continuous Modeling...)(Python or Anylogic) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards) (Steps in the process)

## (Other)
(change the title and amount of headers as needed) (mention datasets you are going to use) (mention base code or examples you)

## Discussion
(final only - remove whole section for proposal Readme) (What would you have done differently) (What are the contributions summerize)(what is the big take away)(what did you learn)

## Future Work
(final only - remove whole section for proposal Readme) (if you had 6 more months what would be the next steps in this project.) (What are a few questions you have now)

## References
(Add the bibliographic references you intend to use)  (Code / Projects / blogs / websites / papers...)
