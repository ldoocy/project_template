(4 sentences: what is the topic (1), what do you want to do (2), why is important (1))

##### Topic:
Our topic involves the impact of architecture on collective behavior.

##### What we want to do:
By integrating different approaches (e.g., social force model, OCEAN/Big Five personality model), 
we seek to model not just crowd behavior, but behavior of different individuals within crowds, and how individual differences affect the degree to which environment influences behavior. 
Additionally, we seek to model how manipulating the environment (e.g., by designing buildings in a certain way) can lead to varying changes in collective behavior as a function of individual differences and social interactions.

##### Why this is important:
By exploring how physical spaces alter human behavior at the individual and crowd level, this work can inform the design of spaces as a means of motivating desired behaviors. Potential applications include:
* Safe evacuation/stampede prevention
* Sustainable behavior (e.g., recycling)
* Healthy behavior (e.g., being more physically active, preventing spread of disease)
